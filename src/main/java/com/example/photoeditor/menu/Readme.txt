Factory Pattern: The Factory pattern is a design pattern that provides an interface
 for creating objects, allowing subclasses to decide the specific class to instantiate.
  It encapsulates the object creation logic, promoting loose coupling and flexibility in the code.
   The pattern abstracts the process of object creation, delegates it to subclasses, and enables
    easy extensibility without modifying existing code:.
